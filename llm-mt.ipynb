Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people have been quarantined and are not allowed anymore to leave the operations.\\nA security service monitors the curfew.\\nAltogether 174 harvesters were tested positive for the Corona virus Sars-CoV-2 at a mass screening as the district administration Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.\\n“In order to avoid a further spreading we unfortunately must take this measure to protect the population”, county commissioner Werner Bumeder (CSU) explained.\\nBefore that already seven coworkers had been infected on this farm - this triggered the mass screening.\\nThe operations concern a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - however the cucumbers only for canning jars.\\nMamming is a rural community with about 3300 residents not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.\\nBumeder called on the citizens to keep calm: “According to our information it concerns a closed group of persons.”\\nOn the farm infected coworkers were separated from non-infected ones, the premises are now fenced in with a construction fence.\\nGreens and SPD blamed the State government for shared responsibility.\\nBoth opposition parties accused prime minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect monitoring the housing for seasonal workers.\\n“That can backfire horribly when such local infections spread and regional lockdowns must be ordered”, said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.\\nThe SPD shares a similar view: “We have asked for a special control program also for farms with harvesters after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse mid May”, said the environmental expert Florian von Brunn.\\n“Especially the hygiene conditions at the work place and the living quarters must - in our view - thoroughly checked.\\nAnd that obviously did not happen.”\\nThe outbreak occurred “predictably”.\\nU-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous fight: A 19 year-old fell onto the track after being pushed\\nA 19 year-old fell onto the track after being pushed during a fight between two groups of young people at U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße.\\nObersendling - A fight broke out between two groups of young people at U-Bahnhof Aidenbachstraße at 16:15h on Friday.\\nA passerby called the police, who called-up multiple squad cars.\\nFollowing initial investigations it seems a boy from Munich (17) pushed a 19 year-old to the floor.\\nThis resulted in the young man slipping over the edge of the platform and falling onto the track.\\nPeople in the 17 year-old’s party helped the fallen boy climb out of the track bed.\\nThere was no danger of a passing train.\\nAnother scuffle followed between the two persons, according to the police.\\nThe 17 year-old proceeded to flee the crime scene, however, his personal details could be retrieved later.\\nHe reported to the 29th police station with his father.\\nAssault charges are being pursued against the 17 year-old.\\nReport: Seehofer pushes for longer telecommunications data retention\\nTelecommunications data retention is currently suspended.\\nHowever, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is pushing for a lengthening of the retention period according to a press report.\\nHe would like to support thereby the fight against child abuse.\\nAccording to a media report, Federal Minster of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is pushing for a longer data retention period: a half-year instead of the current ten weeks.\\nAs reported by the “Bild am Sonntag”, Seehofer asked the Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for an express change to the law.\\nSeehofer wants to strengthen provisions against child abuse thereby.\\nHe thinks that it makes sense “to take up pressing, necessary alterations to the law now,” the newspaper quoted from his release.\\nTelecommunications data retention is suspended at the moment.\\nThis is waiting on a decision from the EuGH.\\nHowever, Seehofer wants the alterations earlier, so that as soon as a likely, positive judgement is handed down, it can be implemented immediately, the letter further stated.\\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper, that the need for legal alterations shall first be sensibly reviewed following a decision from the court.\\nAlready in June Seehofer spoke together with the interior ministers of the states in favor of telecommunications data retention in their fight against child abuse and child pornography.\\nNBA: Strip-club problems for Clippers star Lou Williams\\nUproar in the NBA!\\nLou Williams (33), basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, seems to have left the tournament district in Disney World (Orlando, Florida) with permission to attend a funeral.\\nAccording to US media channels, he then proceeded to visit the “Magic City” strip club in Atlanta that evening.\\nWilliams, who according to ESPN admitted to his visit, is in isolation again and is tested daily for Covid-19.\\nHis reason for the visit: chicken wings.\\n“Sweet Lou,” as he is called in the NBA, had already expressed his love for just these wings in February of last year.\\nThe American wrote: “Magic City and Blue Flame (editorial note: another strip club in Atlanta ) have the best wings in the city.”\\nNBA insider Shams Charania let it be known on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA had subjected Williams to a ten-day quarantine.\\nThat is how the Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test-match phase.\\nThe NBA will play out the season in Disney World.\\nAt this moment, the 22 best teams are preparing with training games for the season finals that begin this Friday night.\\nSöder comments on the Corona situation after mass infection.\\nMunich - Secretary of Health, Melanie Humi (CSU), already announced on Sunday a testing offensive for large farms.\\nYou can watch live the press conference on our homepage.\\nThe case in Mamming, district Dingolfing-Landau, has alarmed authorities and politicians.\\nOn the large vegetable farm are currently working almost 500 harvesters from several countries; more than one third are infected with the Corona virus.\\nIn the meantime the farm has been quarantined; the farm is blocked off with a construction fence.\\nNobody may leave the premises, food is being delivered.\\nThe authorities are offering free of charge Corona tests to the about 3300 locals of the community.\\nSince the harvesters had little contact with the local residents the district administration assumes so far that infections have not spread beyond the farm.\\n“The Pain of Remorse”: Confession from the suspected arsonist of Nantes\\n“My client has shown himself to be very cooperative,” the Lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.\\nThe defense counsel added: “He regrets his actions very much, the confession was liberating for him.\\nHis client was “plagued with remorse and really taken back by the extent of the damage”.\\nIn the case of a verdict, the man is looking at ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros according to the prosecution.\\nThe gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul of Nantes was heavily damaged after a fire last Saturday.\\nThe fire broke out in three places in the church, which were at a considerable distance from one another.\\nLaboratory investigations corroborated the suspicion of arson.\\nThe detained suspect was already arrested just a few hours after the incident.\\nHowever, he was let go after just a day.\\nThe man was a volunteer for the Nantes diocese and was responsible for closing down the cathedral the night of the fire.\\nBecause there was no

discussions about phasing out the 50+1 rule.\\n“German Football should at least discuss setting clear rules and requirements for investors before the EU Commission finishes up with all of the details,” Grindel told the “Bild am Sonntag”.\\nHe continued: “The 50+1 rules don’t work at all for the clubs that would most likely be a danger to Dortmund and Bayern: just look at Leipzig and Leverkusen.\\nIn this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether to make it easier for clubs, which want to break into this Phalanx, to include investors.”\\nHe has doubts, however, about whether the German Football League is ready to allow majority stakes, which are prevented in the league by the 50+1 rule.\\n“There is a judicial risk in putting up investment barriers around the Bundesliga’s business locations in the European Single Market,” said Grindel.\\nThe former DFB head sees a danger that “the attempt to secure fairer competition in the Bundesliga would only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on the European level, and not lead to more excitement in the championship”.\\nEven distribution of TV funds would not even produce a decisive result.\\n“FC Bayern has a revenue of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig a revenue of 300 million.\\nThe difference even between the top three clubs is already immense.\\nThe other 15 clubs have an average budget of about 130 million,” clarified the 58 year-old.\\nGrindel feels betrayed when looking back at the past.\\n“Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and have leaked it to the press instead of bringing it to me directly,” Grindel said referring to the acceptance of an expensive watch, which lead to his resignation in 2019.\\n“The morality of that has weighed heavy on my mind”.\\nThe 11,000 euro watch was a gift from a Ukrainian official.\\n“I committed a breach in compliance, and it was right that I reap the consequences of that,” said Grindel.\\n“I circumvented innocently and with complete transparently with the ominous watch gift.\\nMany in the DFB knew about this”.\\nHe never “made a secret out of the present,” reassured the 58 year-old.\\n“One could call it naive but this form of transparency was the exact opposite of corruption.”\\n“Black Lives Matter”: Many injured and one dead\\nProtests against police brutality in the

the AfD’s federal board had decided the expulsion with majority in May.\\nKalbitz is chairman of the AfD fraction in the Brandenburg state parliament.\\n“If the AfD is really concerned about removing right wing extremists from its party then officials like Björn Höcke and also his followers would have been expelled a long time ago”, said Strasser.\\n“For that there is not political will apparent in the AfD because the right wing extremism belongs to the party by now.”\\nSimilar statements come from the CSU secretary general, Markus Blume: “That Andreas Kalbitz now remains expelled does not say anything and changes nothing”, he said to the “Welt am Sonntag”.\\n“It rather says a lot how many frenetic supporters a right wing extremist still has in the midst of the AfD.”\\nBlume assumes that the AfD will land again below five percent in future elections.\\n“AfD’s days in parliaments are numbered.”\\nKalbitz was spokesman of the ‘wing’ around the Thuringia AfD state and fraction chairman Björn Höcke that had been dissolve officially by now; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ranks the movement as ‘severe right wing extremist attempt’.\\nIn May the AfD federal board threw Kalbitz out of the party.\\nReason for that was that Kalbitz did not inform the party when applying for membership about his earlier membership in the meanwhile forbidden “Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend (HDJ) and with the ‘Republikaner’.\\nKalbitz denies his membership in the HDJ.\\nThe chairman of the left fraction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also insisted that the decision of the federal arbitration court would not change the character of the AfD. “The wolf only ate chalk.\\nThe AfD remains a right extremist party whether with or without Kalbitz.”\\nThis decision would neither weaken the federal party nor its right wing.\\n“The maneuvers of the Meuthen troop is transparent.\\nThey want to escape further observations by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and they try to keep ‘under the radar’”, said Walter.\\n“The AfD can’t get rid of the ghosts it had called on.\\nAn expulsion does still not anything”, was a comment of the Brandenburg SPD secretary general, Erik Stohn, about the decision in the case Kalbitz.\\n“The AfD state association and the fraction stood by their right wing leader.”\\nThe legal dispute about Kalbitz’ membership in the AfD will continue.\\nKalbitz announced on Saturday he will fight the decision by the federal arbitration court in civil court.\\nThe North Sea wind parks deliver 21+ percent more power.\\nThe wind power plants of the German North Sea delivered 11.51 terawatt hours electricity to the net in the first six months of the year.\\nThat is about 21 percent more compared to the same time period of the last year, informed network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.\\nTennet is responsible for the North Sea power transfer and the routing through the German power net.\\nThe wind turbines in the Baltic Sea that do not belong to Tennet’s network delivered another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) power.\\nAltogether, wind generated power from the North and the Baltic Sea generated 13.73 TWH compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half year 2019.\\nThe wind power harvest resembles thus almost 19 percent of the entire wind power in Germany; this is about four percent more than last year.\\nNew wind parks feature higher generation capacities.\\nThe increased contribution of the offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities beside the wind conditions because new wind parks came into the net within the past twelve months.\\nIf the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea would all work with full speed they could generate calculated 6.7 gigawatt energy.\\nThe transfer capacity is sufficient for that; according to Tennet it could handle 7.1 gigawatt.\\nUntil 2030 the capacity should increase to 17 gigawatt in the German North Sea.\\n“Until then we will invest 20 billion Euro in the expansion of the offshore net connections in Germany and the Netherlands”, said Tennet manager Tim Meyerjürgens.\\nIn reality wind parks also at sea cannot exploit their full capacity but reach about 40 percent.\\nThe previous record day in this year was January 2nd when the North Sea wind parks generated more than six gigawatt power.\\nOn average the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt energy; that corresponds with three to for nuclear power plants.\\nWith that almost seven million households can be provided with power.\\nArt “Skirmish” - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the art association Gmünd.\\nThis was almost a little anniversary celebration of the 130tieth\\nbirthday of the Künstlerverein Gmünd.

year.\\nThe city of Freital cancelled the planned three-day festival in September.\\nThe city festival has received up to 30,000 visitors in past years.\\n“We honestly didn’t make this decision lightly - conscious of how financially difficult it will be for those involved - we hoped up to the last moments,” clarified Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Independent).\\n“But as event organizers we are responsible in the end for the health of thousands of people”.\\nIf tens of thousands of people during the festival had taken to the festival grounds, no minimum distance, hygiene concepts or contact tracing could be maintained as stipulated by current Corona protection ordinances.\\nOtherwise, the restrictions would have been so extreme that not much of a folk festival would have remained.\\nFurthermore, the organizational and monitoring expenses would have disproportionately risen by a multitude.\\nRumberg is consoled thinking of next year.\\nThat is when the city of Freital will celebrate its centennial with the Winterberg Festival as well as Saxony Day from the 10th to the 12th of September 2021.\\nDressur - Olympia champion Werth is not to be defeated in

establishment and appointment of the professorship.\\nRepresenting the college since 2019\\nSince the 2019 summer semester, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management program at Worms University as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.\\nNine students are already starting this year\\nUp till now, the experience of the DFS has been very positive, the performance of the students has been commendable.\\nThe combination of study and air traffic control training is contributing significantly to the attractiveness of the air traffic control profession.\\n“In these times, economic support is not easy to come by.\\nWe are counting on air traffic to pick up again and to grow again in the long run.\\nWe need highly qualified personnel in order to be able to fulfill our legal agreement in the future,” said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head chairman of the DFS at the signing of the contract.\\n“The endowed chair is a future-secure investment for the DFS, in order to provide air traffic controllers with a breadth of comprehensive expert base of knowledge in the long run.\\nWe are pursuing a beneficial cooperation with the University and simultaneously

important bridge between the economy and science.\\nWith it, we would like to tie together the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as our practice partner for the dual bachelor program Air Traffic Management.”\\nThe trust of the Deutsche Flugsicherung for the University in Worms is simultaneously a motivation and a responsibility to further build out their teaching and research competence in the forward-looking field of air traffic.\\nThe applied university with its first endowed chair can set up a dual study program with very special highlights and innovative emphases for its students.\\nDr. Denis Alt, State Secretary for the Ministry of Science Education and Culture, emphasized: “The University of Applied Sciences in Worms has a unique selling point in

is on its way.\\nAre they legal, and will things remain like that?\\nThe Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to investigate other sectors after the currently planned, strict measures against abuses in the meat industry.\\n“We are going to look at industry after industry and for each respective industry take suitable measures where needed,” Heil said to the German Press Agency in Berlin.\\nGerman employers are already warning about limiting work contracts in general.\\nAfter the massive corona outbreak at the meat empire Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to conclude this Wednesday a law from Heil.\\nLarge slaughter houses are no longer able to use external staff for slaughtering, disassembly and meat preparation.\\nThe use of contracted and temporary workers is also forbidden there.\\nPresident of employment Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: “Take your finger away from general restrictions on contract labor and personnel leasing if you don’t want to completely stall the economy.”\\nService contracts are necessarily a fundamental part of value creation for customers in, for example, large sectors of craftsmanship, construction and plant manufacturing.\\n“The misconduct of individual actors may not destroy such an important instrument.”\\nHeil assures: “My goal is not to ban contract workers in general from the German economy”.\\nContracts for work make sense.\\n“When an industrial operation contracts a craftsman to construct a security system that is a very normal contract for work.”\\nThe German meat industry claims that a ban on contracts for work and temporary labor in their sector exclusively would go against the constitution.\\nIt has yet to be made explicit why proportioning and packaging of cheese should have different worker rights in the future then for sausage, claimed a statement on the legislative proposal as reported by the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung “ (Saturday).\\nThe user price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product as the result of such a ban.\\nMany Eastern European laborers from contract for work companies work in the branch according to findings from an

“devious designs”.\\n“Now it really needs to be fundamentally cleaned up”\\nThe politician announced: “In the worker protection law that the cabinet would like to conclude at the end of July, which does not just effect the meat industry, rather, for example, leads to higher examination quota for worker protection and clear criteria for shared accommodation.”\\nThe draft laying before the dpa includes changes to the law to secure employee rights in the meat industry as well as the worker protection law.\\nBrandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) sees intensive oversight as necessary.\\n“I would like that we could do even more checks in many areas of regulation: Monitoring of food, animal protection, everything that is possible, for example animal transportation,” said Nonnemacher am Sunday in the RBB program “Brandenburg aktuell”.\\nMore checks are also necessary for staff personnel.\\nThree dead at crash of ultra-light plane in

time in a row.\\nThe team with the five-time World Player of the Year now has 36 in total. Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night at home against Sampdoria Genoa.\\nRonaldo made it 1:0 before halftime.\\nTurin, which has been playing without the long-injured, former national team player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to be ousted from first place with 83 points and two game days before the end of the series A season.\\nThe second position on the chart is occupied by Inter Milan, who is 7 points behind.\\nIn spite of visual superiority, Juventus was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo scored with the final move after a free kick.\\nA pass from Miralem Pjanic lead to the 35 year-old standing right in front of the penalty line with a low shot (45.+7).\\nWorking against guests who were now playing on the offensive, Ronaldo was also able to take part in making it 2:0, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) cleaned up after his shot.\\nThat is how this dull but sure success was secured.\\nThe penalty shot that bounced off of the crossbar in the 89th minute must have only angered Ronaldo himself given his top scorer rank.\\n“It is hard to remain mentally and physically on the level of the ball for 90 minutes.\\nGames are strange and can change easily in a moment”, trainer Maurizio Sarri clarified after a 1:2 against Udinese Calcio on Thursday.\\nThe mental exhaustion of his players is substantial on top of everything else, said the Juve coach.\\nBecause of this defeat, Turiner was still not able to secure the championship with a perfect record.\\nThe jump to the top of the charts was in the end particularity attributable to the weakness of the competition.\\nThis is because the Sarri team had only managed five victories in the eleven games leading up to the game on Sunday.\\nIt remains to be seen whether Ronaldo will remain the top scorer.\\nWhile the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals up till now, Ciro Immobile, who previously played for Dortmund, has 34 goals to his name after his triple score for a 5:1 (1:1) against 4th ranked Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.\\nThe record in Italy goes to the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.\\nThe Argentinian player scored 36 goas for SSC Neapel in the 2015/2016 season.\\nThe “Old Lady” of Italian football is waiting till August for their next chance at a title.\\nJuventus is in the round of 16 of the Champions League and needs to set off a 0:1 first-leg defeat against Olympique Lyonnais on the 7th of August in order to reach the finals tournament in Lissabon.\\nReal Madrid or Manchester City would then be waiting as an opponent in the next KO round.\\nBaden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races reported\\nStuttgart - Despite impending punishment and court decisions drivers still join numerous illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg. In the past year and the first four month of this year the police in the Southwest has already registered more then 250 illegal car races.\\nThere are no comparative numbers for the previous years but the speeders create increasingly work for the juridical authorities. 155 investigative proceedings due to illegal races were performed at public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim in the year 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.\\nThe races were hardly performed as organized events, as it was concluded from a reply of the interior ministry to an inquiry of the Landtag-SPD.\\nIn most cases the drivers would compete with one another spontaneously or they had tried to flee from the police - that is also reported as illegal race.\\nThe cars were driven predominantly by German men in the age between 18 and 60 years old.\\n113 fines - 15 times imprisonment\\nOnly in comparably a few cases the speeders are caught and then fined accordingly. According to the interior ministry altogether 113 fines and 15 imprisonments were imposed since 2018.\\nHowever, there are no real indications that the number of illegal car races does in fact increase.\\nIt is rather a act that other drivers react more sensitive to these races than previously due to some tragic accidents and trials in the past years, and they report them more frequently, said a spokesperson of the ministry.\\nThe speeders love to race especially on the Autobahn 8. Time and again drivers slow down the traffic there to make room and use the free road for a race.\\nPast August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months prior to that even 18 drivers were caught on the A 8 close to Merklingen.\\nThe A 81 is the most favorable “race track”.\\nThe police registers even more races on the A 81 than on any other federal autobahn.\\nWith an imposed speed limit it is attempted to slow down the speeders on the especially frequented section between Engen and Geisingen.\\nThe mostly expensive and tuned-up sports and luxury cars frequently sponsor Swiss license plates because the drivers evade to Germany due to the high penalties for driving too fast and for car races in the neighboring country.\\nFor the SPD speed limits must not be restricted to only a few sections of the roads. “A general speed limit of 130 km/h would do away with this problem on the autobahns”, says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD Landtag fraction.\\n“The psychological barrier for speeders was significantly higher when one could travel - still legally - here and there at 200 km/h and more”.\\nRivoir does not think too much of enlightenment of image campaigns. “Whoever violates all rules in such a way and who risks not only his or her own life but also the life of other road users, he or she can hardly be reached with rationality”.\\nADAC demands more drastic police measures\\nFor the ADAC is this, however, not enough: “We assume that speeders are not deterred by speed limits”, says Holger Bach, manager of the department Traffic and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.\\nHe demands additional and also stricter controlling of the respective road sections.\\nQuite often the high-speed showdowns end in hurt and serious consequences: Since January 2019 until April 2020 three people died state-wide in races, two of them who were non-participants at a nightly crash in the Stuttgart inner city and one in Gerlingen.\\nTwo young men were said to have had a car race in November.\\nOne of the vehicles strayed from the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18 year old passenger died.\\n21 other people were injured at races in the past two years.\\nHowever, tougher penalties are not necessary according to the secretary of the interior, Thomas Strobl. “We don’t see a legislative need for action to sanction illegal car races even harder”, a paper of the interior ministry states.\\nFlashing lights on July 23 Thirsty burglar steels drinks from snack stand\\nRohrdorf: A man broke into a snack stand in Rohrdorf (district Calw) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash money.\\nA witness heard noises in the Talstraße around 3:40 a.m. when he walked towards the snack stand.\\nThere he noticed a man who grabbed drinks from the refrigerator and who left the snack stand subsequently through the front door that was smashed open.\\nThe culprit fled in the direction of the grassland behind the snack stand.\\nAccording to the police the burglar took also money from the cash register and stole cash in a low three-digit amount.\\nThe suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall with a strong build.\\nAt the time of the burglary he wore a black hoody, black pants and light shoes.\\nThe police welcomes further witness information.\\nAckermann sprints to victory on the final leg of the Sibiu Tour.\\nBicycling professional Pascal Ackermann has won his second stage victory at the 10th Sibiu Tour.\\nThe 26 year old Palatinate with the team Bora-Hansgrohe prevailed in the mass finish on the 109 kilometer long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after he had won already a stage on Saturday.\\nThose were the third and fourth seasonal victories for Ackermann.\\nHis Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger is the leader In the overall standing.\\nIn the morning the 26-year old had won the mountain time trial in a superior manner and thus taken the lead in the rankings.\\nOnly 104 drivers started the final stage in the evening.\\nNo less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the uphill time trial.\\n“I am really happy to begin the season new start with a victory”, Ackermann stated after his success on Saturday.\\n“The sprint was really hectic”, said the 26-year old.\\n300 meters before the finish line he had simply tightened his sprint, “and it worked perfectly.”\\nAccording to the UCI’s world federation all race participants and their accompanying team members had to undergo a Corona test before the start of the race.\\nDuring the entire tour drivers and attendances were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organizational team as well as from the media.\\nSpectators at the start and the finish were not admitted.\\nDispatch center gives instructions for layman resuscitation\\nDüsseldorf - A tragic accident near midday on Sunday in Düsseldorf-Garath.\\nA child (4) was suddenly lying lifeless while bathing in an apartment building.\\nAccording to the fire department, the distress call came shortly before 13h.\\n“Dispatch at headquarters immediately requested layman resuscitation,” a spokesman of the fire department said to BILD.\\nThe dispatched rescue team took over the resuscitation procedures shortly after.\\nThe child whose life was in danger was transported to the university hospital while receiving resuscitation.\\nThe reason why it was unsuccessful is unclear.\\nThe police registered it as a routine course of events following an accident.\\nThe spokesman of the fire brigade: “We are assuming a tragic accident occurred in the apartment.”\\nNürnberg: Police intervene in an unauthorized tuning meetup with 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people.\\nHundreds of cars and over 1,000 people showed up to a tuning meetup Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.\\nThe police have announced their intention to more strictly regulate such events.\\nA large tuning meetup took place in a city south of Nürnberg this Saturday evening (25 July, 2020).\\nMany hundreds of vehicles took part.\\nAccording to Mittelfranken Police, an increase presence of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot near a street in Ingolstadt was determined at 22:30h by Nürnberg Police.\\nThat is why the police then carried out multiple vehicle inspections there.\\nThe police have only recently announced their intention to take stronger action against so-called “car posers”.\\nIllegal tuning meetup in Nürnberg: Only a small portion were from the ‘scene’\\nAuthorities counted a max. of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to police.\\nOnly a small portion of those present were part of the “car poser” or the tuning scene.\\nApparently, the larger part of the pertinent scene complied with police appeals.\\nJudging from the vehicles and persons who were found there, the overwhelming majority were simply curious spectators.\\nIn addition, the overwhelming majority of those present were complying with the relevant infection protection measures, especially by maintaining minimum distance and wearing a face mask.\\nThe control measures that took place there were finished around 1:00h.\\nIn total, the police found 10 vehicles who had the type of structural changes, which would invalidate their operating license.\\nFour of these vehicles needed to be seized.\\nNo car races\\nThere were no illegal car races.\\n“The Mittelfranken Police Headquarters will keep the incident in mind, thus leading to further, stronger enforcement measures, even in connection with spectators,” they said.\\nThe News5 agency spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the contracting towing company: “They all have beautiful rims, which we are not allowed to scratch,” Schrödinger said.\\nSpecial bands were used.\\nThe company needed to pay even closer attention not to cause damage, because the cars themselves are wider.\\n“Young people should get their cars back unharmed in the end.”\\nNumbers from the employment agency: 900 cases of suspected abuse of short-term work\\nBerlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is pursuing about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term work.\\n“Given the 888,000 companies who reported short-term work, that is an extremely small amount,” management board member for operations Daniel Terzenbach told the “Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung”.\\nWhen many companies suddenly applied for short-term work at the beginning of the corona crises, the BA needed to react quickly.\\nNormally the review process lasts up to three week.\\n“We didn’t have that kind of time available to us in this critical phase.\\nThat is why we will look even more closely at the final accounts.\\nThere will certainly still be more to come.\\nWe are not naive about that and we have endurance”.\\nThe evidence of abuse often came from affected employees and unions.\\nThe BA’s analytics software was then used to detect the patterns of abuse.\\nThe BA is preparing for a likely wave of insolvencies in Autumn, according to Terzenbach.\\n“Will there be significantly more insolvencies then last year?\\nThe estimates are diverging from one another, but we are arming ourselves for a worst-case scenario and are already training our employees in the employment agency to process applications for insolvency money”.\\nThe numbers are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.\\nWorld heritage in Potsdam: Party in Neuen Garten dissolved\\nPotsdam -

as preventive measure - “to block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and the entire region from others”.\\nThe respective person as well as all other people in Kaesong who were in contact this person had been quarantined.\\nThe party’s military committee should thus investigate the ‘runaway case’ as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if need be, apply severe punishment.\\nAbout 300000 people live in Kaesong according to estimates.\\nTensions before the council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still up for debate before the long summer break.\\n“Beside environmental concerns the members of the board must vote - among others - on the development plan for the major project Inner City Development-East”, it states rather casually in the midsection of the city’s press release referring to the next local council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 16:30 in the large hall of the Congress Center in Pforzheim.\\nEspecially the appreciation of the Eastern part of the city will be controversy discussed till the end.\\nThe majority for that is tight, most recently even dismissive in the various committees depending on the members present.\\nAn appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) to not let the project fail now after almost ten years of preparation, a project that came straight from the citizens and that was developed by administration and local council; this appeal was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as “extra-parliamentary opposition”, “clueless”, “speculation”, slander” and “conscious false statements”.\\n“They all think they know better”, so Klein who is a member of the local council for one year as the lone representative of the Citizen’s List Pforzheim.\\nIn fact, he would be in this position after he had read the contracts: “I know what I am talking about”.\\nThe withdrawal would be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall could be renovated for 8.5 million Euro contrary to statements from the city administration, namely after grants, which are real in my view.\\nThe city would develop in totally different ways, different from what they forecast in city hall and from what is said by economics.\\nThe city must grow through its own strength and not through investors. That would be his plan B. One day after Klein the FDP/FW/UB/LED fraction, which also dismisses the project, presented an alternative concept.\\nIt stipulates essentially also the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the keeping open of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a small-scale redesign of the inner city ideally with local public sponsors.\\nEnvironmental concerns play a central role.\\nBeside that environmental concerns will in particular play a central role.\\nTherefore, the local council will, among others, vote on a noise protection action plan.\\nThis plan contains diverse measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health related noise pollution caused by road traffic - some of the measures are speed reductions.\\nIn a press release the local automobile club Germany welcomed the introduction to a speed limit of 30 km/h. The politicians responsible in the city are not free of blame that it had to come to that because they neglected the public bus service with reduced cycle times and because they showed little interest in building up bicycle lanes - all that lead to a massive increase of the car traffic and thus contributed to the increased noise, stated the VCD.\\nThe local council will also vote on the city’s participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Entkreis.\\nAlso on the agenda is the accession to the environment protection pact of the State Baden-Württemberg, the new adjustment of parental contributions to the city’s children day care centers and the application for entry in the Federal smart-city-support program.\\nCitizens are welcome but must comply with Corona protection measures.\\nTim Zimmermann starts into the season with a great delay\\nTim Zimmermann starts in his premier season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with a delay of almost half a year.\\nBefore the league of super sports cars can start regular operations the first test drives were scheduled.\\nFor Zimmermann it was first of all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 much closer.\\nThe Corona crisis prevented for a long time that Tim Zimmermann could tackle his first official test drive in his new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.\\nThis was possible now under special hygiene conditions.\\nThe 23 year old from Langenargen spun his first rounds at the Lausitzring and could get a feel for his premiere in the GT3 car.\\n“There are indeed a few things that differ from the Porsche of the previous season”, says Zimmermann.\\n“With the ABS one must for example take curves quite differently.\\nBut I had really great fun with it”.\\nZimmermann had also fun with Steijn Schothorst with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.\\nThe man from the Netherlands is quite experienced in the GT sport despite his young age of 25 years and he could help his new teammate with many things.\\n“I am not at all a beginner in motor sports but each new series brings along new challenges”, says Zimmermann.\\n“Steijn and I understand one another splendidly and at the Lausitzring we enormously progresses from season to season”.\\nExactly there -
